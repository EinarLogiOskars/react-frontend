# React frontend

This project is a WIP. I started this project to be used as a frontend for a DVD rental app I am creating using Python Flask.

## Usage

To get functionality for this website you will need to pull: https://github.com/EinarLogiOskars/dvdrental-python. \
This repo is a docker app containing a Postgres database and a Python Flask backend.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `Alternatively`

The website has been published via GitHub Pages - Visit https://einarlogioskars.github.io/react-frontend/ \ - This option will still require the app repo to be pulled.
